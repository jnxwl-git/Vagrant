So I've uninstalled PIP and re-installed PIP 19.1.1 as follows:

Uninstall incompatible PIP provided by distro repository:

sudo apt remove --purge python3-pip
Download a get-pip.py version which is compatible with my Python version 3.4:

curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/3.4/get-pip.py
Install PIP (in my case with sudo as global installation and with -E to apply proxy settings to sudo session):

sudo -E python3 get-pip.py
Optional: Upgrade PIP to ensure it's the latest available version:

sudo -E python3 -m pip install --upgrade "pip < 19.2"
Check version:

python3 -m pip --version
Ouput:

pip 19.1.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/pip (python 3.4)
